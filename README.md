## Features
- Automates login to Betika (requires manual navigation to the Aviator game after login).
- Extracts payout data and stores it in a SQLite database.
- Alerts the user if no new data is detected for 3 minutes.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- The following Python libraries:
  - `selenium`
  - `playsound`
  - `sqlite3` (comes with Python by default)
- **Google Chrome** browser.
- **ChromeDriver**: Must be installed and compatible with your version of Chrome.

## Setup and Installation
1. Install Python and ensure itâ€™s added to your PATH.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium playsound
Download ChromeDriver:
Match the version to your Chrome browser.
Add the chromedriver file to your system PATH or provide its path in the script:
python

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="path/to/chromedriver")
Update the script with your Betika login details:
python

phone_input.send_keys("your phone number")  # Replace with your phone number
password_input.send_keys("your password")  # Replace with your password
How to Use
Run the script:
bash

python aviator_scraper.py
Log in automatically using your credentials.
Manually navigate to the Aviator game after logging in.
Let the script extract payout data and save it in the SQLite database (aviator_rounds35_1.db).
If no data is detected for 3 minutes, the script will play an alert sound.
Notes
Ensure that ChromeDriver is correctly installed and matches your Chrome version.
The SQLite database (aviator_rounds35_1.db) will be created in the same directory as the script.
The alert sound file path (extractionfail.wav) may need to be updated.
